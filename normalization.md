Objective: Confirming Third Normal Form (3NF)
The goal of normalization is to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. The database schema provided is already well-normalized. This document explains why the design meets the criteria for the first three normal forms.

1. First Normal Form (1NF) Analysis
Rule:

Each column must hold atomic (indivisible) values.

There must be no repeating groups of columns.

Each row must be uniquely identified by a primary key.

Assessment:

Atomicity: All columns in the schema store atomic values. For example, first_name and last_name are stored separately in the users table rather than as a single full_name column.

No Repeating Groups: The design correctly avoids repeating groups. For instance, instead of having columns like amenity_1, amenity_2 in the places table, a many-to-many relationship is established using the place_amenity junction table. This is the correct way to model this relationship.

Primary Keys: Every table has a primary key (id), ensuring each record is unique.

Conclusion: The schema fully complies with 1NF.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF) Analysis
Rule:

The table must be in 1NF.

All non-key attributes must be fully dependent on the entire primary key. (This is primarily a concern for tables with composite primary keys).

Assessment:

Most tables (users, states, cities, places, amenities, reviews) use a single-column primary key (id). By definition, if a table is in 1NF and has a single-column primary key, it is automatically in 2NF because there are no partial dependencies possible.

The place_amenity table has a composite primary key (place_id, amenity_id). However, it has no other non-key attributes. Therefore, it trivially satisfies 2NF.

Conclusion: The schema fully complies with 2NF.

3. Third Normal Form (3NF) Analysis
Rule:

The table must be in 2NF.

There must be no transitive dependencies. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute, rather than on the primary key itself.

Assessment:
The schema has been designed to avoid transitive dependencies. Let's consider the most likely place one could occur: the relationship between places, cities, and states.

A place is in a city (places.id → cities.id).

A city is in a state (cities.id → states.id).

A transitive dependency would exist if the state_id were stored directly in the places table. This would mean places.id → cities.id → states.id.

The current design correctly avoids this. The places table only stores city_id. To find the state of a place, you must join the places table with the cities table. This means the state is dependent on the city, not transitively on the place. All other non-key attributes in each table (like places.name, users.email, etc.) depend directly on their respective primary keys, not on other non-key attributes.

Conclusion: The schema fully complies with 3NF. No changes are required.
